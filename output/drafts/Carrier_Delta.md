- **Gets (What we offer in return):**  
  - A path to more competitive, stable long-term capacity through a data-driven alignment to our targets, while preserving a strong carrier relationship.
  - Continued partnership on valuable lanes with clear expectations around service considerations (free days, transit times, and operational alignment).

## Next Steps

- Please confirm whether Delta can bridge the gap toward our target levels by adjusting free days to ≥11 days at origin and destination and confirming acceptance of the operational requirements for both lanes.
- Propose revised terms for L004 and L006 within five (5) business days. If agreeable, we’d like to schedule a 30-minute call to finalize terms early next week.
